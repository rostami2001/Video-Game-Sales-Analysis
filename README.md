# Video-Game-Sales-Analysis

This repository contains my first data mining project, completed during the Spring 2024. The project covers key data mining techniques, including data preprocessing, quality assessment, frequent pattern extraction, clustering, and classification.

---

## Project Phases  
1. **Data Understanding & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values, outliers, normalization, and feature engineering.  
   - Data quality assessment using ISO 25012 metrics (completeness, validity, etc.).  

2. **Frequent Pattern Extraction**  
   - Implemented Apriori algorithm (`mlxtend`) to analyze relationships between game genres, publishers, and sales.  

3. **Clustering & Classification**  
   - Applied `K-Means` and hierarchical clustering to group similar game attributes.  
   - Evaluated classifiers (SVM, Decision Trees) to predict user scores.  

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - Generated box plots, histograms, and cluster visualizations using `matplotlib/seaborn`.
